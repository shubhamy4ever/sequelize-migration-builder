## Development Setup

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
   - First, ensure you have all the dependencies installed:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### 2. **Install Peer Dependencies for Development (Temporarily)**
   - Since this package has `mysql2` and `sequelize` as peer dependencies, you may need to install them temporarily for development or testing purposes while working on the code. To do so, run:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev mysql2 sequelize
     ```

   - **Important**: After contributing and before pushing your changes, **manually remove the temporary devDependencies** by:
     1. Opening your `package.json`.
     2. Removing `mysql2` and `sequelize` from the `devDependencies` section.
     3. Running `npm install` to reflect the changes in `node_modules`.

### 3. **Run the Application Locally**
   - Run the application locally or ensure everything works as expected by testing any feature or using the package.

### 4. **Commit and Push Changes**
   - Once you're done with your changes and testing, commit and push your contributions. Ensure that the temporary dependencies (`mysql2` and `sequelize`) were removed before pushing.
